# ecommerce

This project was implemented following this course: https://www.udemy.com/course/microservices-architecture-and-implementation-on-dotnet/
I tried to implement the way the teacher told, but I made a few changes to adapt the code to support .NET 6.
I can also make some changes in the future if I found necessary or just nice yo do it.

The stack of this project is:
- .NET 6
- Redis
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL
- MSSQL
- Entity Framework
- RabbitMQ
- Razor
- Ocelot
- Docker (obviously)

There is a bit of DDD and CQRS, but the project is really small so that might go unnoticed.
